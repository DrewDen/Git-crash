    <h1>The ins and outs of Git and GitHub</h1>
    <p>This is a clone from Brad Treversy video thatis called Git and GitHub Crash Course. I am following along refreash
        my skills on git and Git Hub.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using<strong>Touch</strong>command in git bash you can create new files.</li>
        <li>Next step would be using git init</li>
        <li>Next would be to add your username and user email</li>
        <li>If you want to add files to your repository you can use the command <em>git add [file your adding]</em>in
            git bash</li>
        <li>Always use git status. This will show the changes you made.</li>
        <li>If you mad a mistake on adding a file using <em>git rm--cached[file your removing]</em>is the command to use
            to remove the file</li>
        <li>If you want to add all your files you could use <em>git add .</em>and this will add all the changes you made
            to your files. Also I believe using the * key will also work</li>
        <li>Next you can commit your files using <em>git commit</em>. If you use this metthod two options can come into
            play:
        <li>
            1. Your code editor will pop up and a seprate widow will appear letting you write in a comment.
        </li>
        <li>
            2.
        </li>
        </li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
