        <h1>The ins and outs of Git and GitHub</h1>
        <p>
            This is a clone from Brad Treversy video thatis called Git and GitHub Crash Course. I am following along refreash my skills on git and Git Hub.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Using <strong>Touch</strong> command in git bash you can create new files.
            </li>
            <li>Next step would be using git init</li>
            <li>Next would be to add your username and useremail</li>
            <li>
                If you want to add files to your repository you can use the command <strong>git add [file your adding]</strong>in git bash
            </li>
            <li>Always use git status. This will show the changes you made.</li>
            <li>
                If you mad a mistake on adding a file using <strong>git rm--cached[file your removing]</strong>is the command to use to remove the file
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want to add all your files you could use <strong>git add.</strong>and this will add all the changes you made to your files. Also I believe using the * key will also
                work
            </li>
            <li>
                Next you can commit your files using <strong>git commit</strong>. If you use this metthod two options can come into play:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        1. Your code editor will pop up and a seprate widow will appear letting you write in a comment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2. You can use<em>git commit -m'whatever you want to put between this two parentheses'</em>and this will skip you code editor opening up.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                By adding a <strong>.gitignore</strong> file different files can be choosen to be ignored
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>Branches</h2>
        <p>
            This section will branches. Branches is a great way to work on code without effected the source code. This is very helpful when working with other developers on projects together.
