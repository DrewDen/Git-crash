        <h1>The ins and outs of Git and GitHub</h1>
        <p>This is a clone from Brad Treversy video thatis called Git and GitHub Crash Course. I am following along refreash
            my skills on git and Git Hub.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using <strong>Touch</strong> command in git bash you can create new files.</li>
            <li>Next step would be using git init</li>
            <li>Next would be to add your username and user email</li>
            <li>If you want to add files to your repository you can use the command <strong>git add [file your
                    adding]</strong>in git bash</li>
            <li>Always use git status. This will show the changes you made.</li>
            <li>If you mad a mistake on adding a file using <strong>git rm--cached[file your removing]</strong>is the
                command to use
                to remove the file</li>
            <li>If you want to add all your files you could use <strong>git add .</strong>and this will add all the changes
                you made
                to your files. Also I believe using the * key will also work</li>
            <li>Next you can commit your files using <strong>git commit</strong>. If you use this metthod two options can
                come into
                play:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        1. Your code editor will pop up and a seprate widow will appear letting you write in a comment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2. You can use <em>git commit -m'whatever you want to put between this two parentheses'</em>and this
                        will skip you code editor opening up.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>By adding a <strong>.gitignore</strong> file different files can be choosen to be ignored</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Branches</h2>
        <p>This section will cover branches. Branches are great to use when colaborating with a other developer on a
            project. This gives you chance to leave the main source code alone so you can work on a copy of it.
        </p>
        <h2>Here are some steps to go by when working with branches</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To set up a branch us the command <strong>git branch [name of new branch]</strong> this will set up a new
                branch.
            </li>
            <li>
                After you set that up you can switch to it using the command <strong>git checkout [branch name]</strong> and
                this will switch to that branch.
            </li>
            <li>
                You will now be on a seprate branch from the master. You can add any code you want into the new branch.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want to switch back into the master branch you can you use the command <strong>git checkout
                    master.</strong> This will switch you back into the master branch and you will see any code you created
                on the other branch removed.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you looking to add the two branches together you can use a command called <strong>git merge</strong> and
                it will combined the branches together.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you use merge yoo have to be on the branch where you want your other branch to merge into.
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>example I want branch login to merge in with the master branch. I would need to be on the master branch for
                this to happen: on master branch git merge login.</p>
        </ul>
